## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for JMinor. Here are some advices for our users that want to report an issue:

1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of JMinor. The issue that you are about to report may be already fixed in the latest master branch version: https://github.com/uditalias/jminor/tree/master.
2. Providing us reproducible steps for the issue will shorten the time it takes for it to be fixed. A JSFiddle is always welcomed, and you can start from this [basic one](https://jsfiddle.net/udidu/7x38s4gb/1).
3. Some issues may be browser specific, so specifying in what browser you encountered the issue might help.
